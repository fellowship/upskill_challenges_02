# Spreadsheet Challenge

## Overview

Your goal for this challenge is to perform some data analysis, complete a series of exercises, and summarize your results. You should use Excel to complete the analysis, questions, and present your findings.

## Instructions

The [Excel File](https://github.com/fellowship/upskill_challenges_02/blob/main/Spreadsheet/Spreadsheet_Challenge_V2.xlsx) contains all the necessary details. Download the file, rename it _**yourfirstname_yourlastname_excel.xlsx**_, read the instructions, and complete the exercises.

## Guidelines

- Don't overwrite your original data, expand it.
- All your work and findings should be in the spreadsheet.
- Summarize your results like you're presenting the findings to key leadership stakeholders.
- Unless otherwise specified, how you present your findings is up to you: numbers, graphs, tables, etc.

## Deliverables

Compress the Excel file and upload it to OneDrive, Google Drive, or DropBox.

## Deadline
[Log in](https://www.launchpad.ai/upskill/levis/login) to your account and upload the public file sharing link via the dashboard. Don't put your file in a folder before compressing; compress the file itself. Challenges should be submitted no later than midnight PST on August 25 for all employees.
